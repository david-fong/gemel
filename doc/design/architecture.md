# Project Architecture

Since I want to support natively compiling and running, I will probably use [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) and the LLVM. This my first time using them, so I'll inevitably do some rookie nonos. Any correction and guidance will be appreciated. My initial motivation though was to focus mostly on the front end of things. For the web frontend, I'm going to try to go without a framework in order to avoid their limitations (I'll use one if I find a reason that compels me to).

I'm looking into using WebRTC for the communications (perhaps through libp2p, but right now the rust implementation doesn't come with support for the webRTC transport). I need to decide what format I want to transport in (JSON vs a more compressed and maybe schema-less format), and whether I want the webview or tauri-backend to be the clientside communications gateway. These decisions will need to go hand in hand with other decisions like how I want to balance business-logic between the client webview and tauri-backend, and what alternative frontends I want to favour supporting: particularly a web-only frontend that can't run native code, or a terminal frontend that can.
