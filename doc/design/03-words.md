# Words

Note: My own thoughts on word choice can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/david-fong/58d7f538fc8cde5f626c512d13b8b30f).

- Spelling. (This is a _maybe_ goal).
  - People having different preferences on brevity of terminology (ex "element" vs "elem" vs "el", or "event" vs "ev").
  - British and American spellings of words.
  - People who don't speak English needing to learn english in order to participate in open-source projects or use libraries.
  - Solution: What if our human-readable identifiers were represented as compositions of words, and we could have dictionaries of different spellings of those words? This starts building the foundation for things like standard dictionaries and automatic human-language translation.
