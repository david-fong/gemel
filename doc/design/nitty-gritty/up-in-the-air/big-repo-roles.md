# Roles Useful for Big Repos

From the POV of someone who has only once maintained a repo with more than 4 people (and only for a short duration), here are my guesses on what kind of roles are needed to maintain a large repo.

- Leadership. Overall vision casting, responsibility for damages/losses/failures, complete administrative privilege.

- Core team of contributors.

- Administrative assistance for privilege management.

- Issue-pool maintenance and curation. Deduplication, triaging, bridging between internal-core-team and issue-raisers. Keeping tabs on what users want to see prioritized.

- Community teaching.

- Documentation overseeing. Makes sure that documentation is organized and kept up to date.

All these people need to communicate together about what's currently happening, what needs to happen, what's going to happen, what they need each other to do.
