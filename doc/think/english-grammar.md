English is a Subject-Verb-Object language read from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.

In OOP, there isn't really a a subject (I don't think?). The current convention is weird if you think about it: functions are a verb with multiple objects where the verb goes first, and methods are the same except one of the objects is special and goes before the verb.
