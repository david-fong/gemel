## Variable Type and Name

Putting types before names makes sense for describing layout for low-level protocol _messages_ (ex. TCP headers, hardware IO interfaces, etc). Where manual data layout control (fiddling with ordering, padding / alignment) isn't a concern, it is more helpful to place names before types, assuming parts of objects are defined in a multiline fashion with left-alignment, and names and types not being formatted into distinct visual columns via whitespace.

## Function Name Before, After, or Between Args

English is a Subject-Verb-Object language read from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.

In OOP, there isn't really a subject (I don't think?). The current convention is weird if you think about it: functions are a verb with multiple objects where the verb goes first, and methods are the same except one of the objects is special and goes before the verb.
