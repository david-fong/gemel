# Cool Things in Other Languages

- C# terse accessor syntax.
- Rust traits and trait objects.
- [dart's meta annotations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/meta-library.html).
- dart's continuation operator.
  - I like the concept, but I would look for something terser.
- Rust utf8 strings. Plenty other languages use utf16 implicitly and the fact isn't often touched upon in their communities (not many devs wonder, find out, or care).
- Rust's match expression.
- kotlin's various async things.
- kotlin's separation of array streaming methods that delay evaluation and those that don't.
- kotlin's async functions being able to be called as blocking functions in functions not marked as async.
