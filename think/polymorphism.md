I'll try to learn from Rust's dyn (trait object) mechanism for doing things involving vtables. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html

But what about use cases where you want to query all typing information about an object at runtime? Ex. complicated class hierarchies like DOM node types?
